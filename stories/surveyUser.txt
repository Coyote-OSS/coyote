User stories:

1. As an administrator, I want to enroll any number of users in the survey, 
   so that I can measure their experiment choices.

2. As an administrator, I want to filter out uninterested users, 
   so that my measurements are not biased.

3. As an administrator, I want users to see the feature before selecting it,
   so that their choices are less influenced by immediate impressions, leading to less biased measurements.

4. As an administrator, I want to instruct users on how to change their choices,
   so that the measurements are more statistically valid.

5. As an administrator, I want users to experience their choices on the live website,
   so that they might reconsider their choices, reducing bias.
